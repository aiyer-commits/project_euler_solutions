sum of alls multiple of 3 or 5 below n

a multiple is 3*p or 5*p...
so you need all of the primes to do it?

what about in reverse...
divide out 3 and 5 from n, move by remainder downward...
if no remainder... jump by divisor down until you get to zero...
but be careful to not double count...

sum = 0

if (n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0) or (n % 3 == 0): sum += n, n -= 3
elif n % 5 == 0: sum += n, n -= 3
else: n -= n % 5
